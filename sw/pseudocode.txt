rack array = [[0,0],[0,0]] [[A bot, A top], [B bot, B top]]
- track which racks have been visited (rack[m][n] += 1)

track which branch the robot is in (A/B)

6 boxes in each rack -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

unloading bay int (0,1,2,3) blue -> green -> yellow -> red

- reset logic
    - pushbutton for hard reset
    # - microswitch for soft reset (back to start position but retains memory)

- pathfinding loop
    - pathfinding logic
        - at start, go forward until line is found
        - once line is found, turn junction based on rack completion 
            - if (sum(rack[0]) == 12), turn right
            - else turn left
        - follow line, turning at each rack junction
        - enter rack line, reel detection 
            - reel return logic

    - line detection (narrow trapezium)
        - if both front are ON, continue until one rear is ON
        - if one front is OFF, correct in direction of ON

    - junction logic
        - if either rear sensor is ON (ignore other rear), turn that way until same rear reengages as ON (fronts remain always ON)
        - if both rear ON (stop line/t-junction) go based on hardcoded instructions 

reel detect loop
    - reel detection
        - use distance sensor on side of chassis to check each box before turning
        - if output is HIGH, initiate turn 
        - if output is LOW, increment rack[m][n] += 1 and continue
        - as a safety redundancy:
            - check every box using grabbers
            - if reel not detected, increment rack[m][n] += 1 and continue 
            - if grabbers find reel, ignore other racks (rack[m][n] = 6), grabber logic

pickup/unload loop
    - reel identification (resistance detection)
        - based on reel picked up, determine which unloading bay to return to (by resistance)
        - continue to next rack

    - reel return logic (loading bay as input)
        - tell grabbers where to drop based on reel resistance
        - hard code direction instruction to each colour of loading bay
        - start again continuing to next rack
