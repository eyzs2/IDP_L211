rack array = [[0,0],[0,0]] [[A bot, A top], [B bot, B top]]
- track which racks have been visited (rack[m][n] += 1)

track which branch the robot is in (A/B)

unloading bay int (0,1,2,3) blue green red yellow


- line detection
    - if both are ON, continue
    - if one is OFF, correct in direction of ON
- junction logic
    - if either rear sensor is ON, turn that way until both front are ON
    - if both rear ON (stop line/t-junction) go based on hardcoded instructions 
- reel detection
    - if forward sensor detects reel, ignore other racks (rack[m][n] = 6), grabber logic
        - reel identification (resistance detection)
            - based on reel picked up, determine which unloading bay to return to (by resistance)
    - if reel not detected, increment rack[m][n] += 1

- reel return logic (loading bay as input)
    - grabber true, 

- pathfinding logic
    - at start, go forward until line is found
    - once line is found, turn junction based on rack completion 
        - if (sum(rack[0]) == 12), turn right
        - else turn left
    - follow line, turning at each rack junction
    - enter rack line, reel detection 
        - reel return logic
